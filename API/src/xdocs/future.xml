    <s1 title="The future">
      <p>     
	We see ourselves extending the functionality of the desktop
	itself. All of these features are planned.      
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Multi lingual desktop.
        </li>
        <li>
          User login and log out
        </li>
        <li>
          Improved Mime type support - Mime type aware panels will be usable in The File browser and web browser
        </li>
        <li>
        New Window Managers.
	  - Mac, Next, Amiga, Beos....

        </li>
        <li>
          Hot Window Manager changing (just like KDE, Gnome etc. under linux) - log off, choose new WM, log in.
        </li>
        <li>
          Patching of AWT usage to Swing - this will allow Java 1 applet support without the well known "heavyweight component in lightweight container" feature/bug.
        </li>
        <li>
	  Support for Tear-off Applets - In your browser, choose "tear-off applet" while mouse is over applet in web page  - this will install that applet as an app, and not require that you are subsequently connected to the internet to use it.        
        </li>
        <li>
	  Remote usage, Connect via an remote stub application, applet, or remote Java Web Start (TM) app.       
        </li>
        <li>
 	  Better control of window positions and size at launch.        
        </li>
        <li>
	  More Shells.  - Ant may well be improved soon so that all of its commands can be invoked from a command line type console inside Jesktop. - we will also have commands that are NanoContainer and Jesktop specific e.g. "Shutdown".      
        </li>
        <li>	  
          Security polices for Jars. - things like clock that require no special resources, can run inside a sandbox. - other applications can ask for permission to read/write to specific directories and other permissions.
        </li>        
      </ul>
